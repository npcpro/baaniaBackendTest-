# Create a Rest API with Express, PostgreSQL, TypeOrm, and TypeScript

On this occasion, I'm going to try to explain how to create a simple Rest API using Express framework, PostgreSQL, and coding with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that Node.js (>= 10.13.0) is installed on your operating system and docker.

You can follow the tutorial at [Create a Rest API with Express, PostgreSQL, TypeOrm, and TypeScript](https://bautistaj20.medium.com/create-a-rest-api-with-express-postgresql-typeorm-and-typescript-ac42a20b66c7).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bautistaj/expressApi
```
```bash
cd expressApi
```

```bash
npm run install
```

```bash
npm run tsc
```

node ./build/server.js
```
